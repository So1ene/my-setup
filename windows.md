## Using Powershell

## Table of Contents:

- Git and GitHub
- Windows Terminal
- Fancy your Terminal
- Visual Studio Code

If you run into any issues, update to the latest version of windows, including 'optional' updates. If you still have issues, contact me!


## Git and GitHub

Download and install VS Code

Make sure you have a github account

Download and install git bash for windows: https://gitforwindows.org/
I personally keep all the default settings, except I uncheck 'Git GUI' because I never use it, I only use git via the command line. You can keep it checked and use the GUI if you want. Set the IDE to VS Code

Run Powershell **as administrator**, type the following commands.


Check you have git and OpenSHH for windows correctly installed:
```powershell
git --version
ssh -V
```

Congratulations, you now have simple bash commands like `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `cat`, `find`...

Next, configure your git information. This is used by git to track who made what changes, etc.

Change 'Firstname' and 'Lastname' to your name:

```powershell
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
```
Change to the email of your github account:
```powershell
git config --global user.email typeyouremail@email.com
```
Double check the above information and change again if needed:
```powershell
git config --global --list
```

Generate a git ssh keygen to link to your github:

Replace "comment" with whatever you want (ie: "Work laptop")
```powershell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "comment"
```

It might ask you to enter which file to save the keygen in. DO NOT TYPE ANYTHING, just press enter, and it will generate a file for you.

It might also ask you to make a password for the file.

Afterwards it should have generated a file `C:/Users/%UserName%/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`. Navigate to it, open it with notepad or something and copy the keygen from the generated file.
The keygen should be 1 line and begin with 'ssh-ed25519'
Paste the keygen into github: https://github.com/settings/ssh/new
Call the title whatever you want.

You can now test it by cloning a repository, go to any github repo and copy the SSH of the repo. (For example, this one is `git@github.com:So1ene/my-setup.git`)
Navigate to your desktop in powershell:
```powershell
cd ~/Desktop
```
And clone it there so you can easily delete it after. The first time you will have to confirm, type `yes`
```powershell
git clone <paste SSH KEY>
```
Here are some useful git commands if you ever feel stuck: https://dzone.com/articles/top-20-git-commands-with-examples


## Windows Terminal

Download and install Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store

Open it then click on the arrow next to the tab and you should see "Settings". Click on that, then on the left you should see 'profiles' click on the first one (Windows Powershell) and in the field called 'command line' add `-noLogo` so that it looks like this `powershell.exe  -noLogo`.

You can also change the starting directory if you like. I set mine to my work folder so that it is much easier to use every day. `"startingDirectory": "C:/whatever/you/want"`.
Save settings and close.


## Fancy your Terminal

I use oh-my-posh! It's a windows version of oh-my-zsh, this will make your windows terminal look like linux zsh terminal!
https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/pwsh
Open windows terminal **as administator**.

Run these commands:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
```powershell
Install-Module posh-git -Scope CurrentUser
```
Type Y for yes twice
```powershell
Install-Module oh-my-posh -Scope CurrentUser
```
```powershell
Set-PoshPrompt
```
Your terminal will look weird for a while.
```powershell
if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE )) { New-Item -Type File -Path $PROFILE -Force }
```
```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

A notepad should open up. Add these lines to the notepad and save:
```
Import-Module posh-git -DisableNameChecking
Import-Module oh-my-posh -DisableNameChecking
Set-PoshPrompt -Theme robbyrussel
function home { cd ~ }
function desktop { cd ~/Desktop }
function documents { cd ~/Documents }
function downloads { cd ~/Downloads }
clear
```
Restart your terminal

I added functions to quick-travel between places in the command line, feel free to add your own. That way you can just type "`desktop`" and you will easily change directory to your desktop from anywhere. For example, I work with WAMP and I would like a shortcut to the WAMP `www` folder which is a pain to navigate to, so I open the profile with `notepad $PROFILE` and add this line before `clear`:
```
function wamp { cd C:/wamp64/www }
```
That way I can simply type "wamp" and it will navigate me to that folder.

You can also choose a different theme than RobbyRussell, but that is my favorite. 
Browse themes here: https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes/

If you like the RobbyRussell theme like I do but would rather see the whole file path instead of just the current folder name, you can easily change that in theme setting, navigate to `%UserProfile%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\oh-my-posh\`, open the version folder, open the Themes folder, and then open the file `robbyrussel.omp.json` with VSCode and change this:
```
        {
          "type": "path",
          "style": "plain",
          "foreground": "#56B6C2",
          "properties": {
            "style": "folder"
          }
        },
```
to this:
```
        {
          "type": "path",
          "style": "plain",
          "foreground": "#56B6C2",
          "properties": {
            "style": "full"
          }
        },
```

You can also mess around with colors etc while you're in there if you want. I personally love the default colors of that theme.


## Visual Studio Code

I use Visual Studio Code because it has a built-in terminal and lots of really amazing extensions.

1. Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) 
2. Download and install useful extensions

Here are the extentions I use as a web developer:
- Dark theme:
[An Old Hope Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dustinsanders.an-old-hope-theme-vscode)
- Light theme just in case: 
[Newbie Light Color Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lunakoly.newbie-light-color-theme)
- [Color Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight)
- [CSS Peek](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranaygp.vscode-css-peek)
- [ERB Helper Tags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rayhanw.erb-helpers)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [HTML CSS Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ecmel.vscode-html-css)
- [IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zignd.html-css-class-completion)
- [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
- [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass)
- [Pytho](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Ruby on Rails](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hridoy.rails-snippets)
- [Sass](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Syler.sass-indented)
- [Sublime Text Keymap and Settings Importer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings)


Restart VS Code.

Press `Ctrl ,` to go to settings, click extensions and click "Live sass compiler". Look for `Live Sass Compile › Settings: Formats` and click'edit in settings.json'. and change the save path to `"savePath": "~/.."` This will save the css file outside of the sass folder, wherever you place it. 
We also want browser support, so look for `liveSassCompile.settings.autoprefix` and change it to this:
```
"liveSassCompile.settings.autoprefix": [
    "defaults",
    "> 1%",
    "last 2 versions"
],
```
Save the file and close it.
On the bottom of the window there is a 'Watch Sass' button, whenever you are coding in sass/scss you can compile it live by clicking on that button.

Press `Ctrl ,` to go to settings, type 'php' in the search bar and look for `PHP › Validate: Executable Path` and click'edit in settings.json'.
Add in the path to php.exe (mine is `C:/wamp64/bin/php/php7.4.9/php.exe`)

Press `Ctrl K` then `Ctrl T` and it will open a list of your installed themes. Cycle through them with the arrow keys and choose one that you like!

If you click on new terminal, a powershell terminal will appear with the same styling that you set up. Cool feature right? You can push to github directly from there! Also uing the 'output' tab for the live sass compiler is extremely useful to view errors.


You are now ready to code! You can click on the leftmost icons to travel between 'files', 'search', 'source control' (this is git! you can view your changes here), 'run' (you can run scripts etc, never used it personally), and 'extensions'.

  <summary>👉&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL) 👈</summary>

## WSL Setup instructions

- Text editor
- Package manager
- Terminal
- Setup git and GitHub
- Install Ruby


## Prerequisites

Before we start, it is important you meet the following prerequisites to ensure the smooth running of the setup.
Take your time to read through everything and do not hesitate to ask for help if you feel stuck.

Ready? Let's go :sunglasses:



### Windows 10

For this setup, you need to be using the latest version of Windows.

This means that you need to be on **Windows 10**, with all the latest updates installed.

To check your Windows version:


>\- Press `Windows` + `R`  
>\- Type  `winver`  
>\- Press `Enter`

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :x: If it does not mention **Windows 10**, you cannot proceed with this setup — but do not panic! You can always upgrade to Windows 10!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: If the first words of this window are **Windows 10** you're good to go! :muscle:


---

#### :wrench: Potential Fixes

<details>
  <summary>Upgrade to Windows 10</summary>

  &nbsp;
  - Download Windows 10 from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10ISO)
  - Install it. It should take roughly an hour, but this is dependent on your computer
</details>

---


Once you're sure that you're using Windows 10, you will need to check that your computer has all the latest updates.



### Latest version of Windows

Open Windows Update:


>\- Press `Windows` + `R`
>\- Type  `ms-settings:windowsupdate`
>\- Press `Enter`
>
>
>\- Click on `Check updates`

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: If you have updates available please install them and repeat the process until it says that you are up to date :star:.


---

#### :wrench: Potential Fixes

<details>
  <summary>Activate Windows Update Service to fix Updates</summary>

  &nbsp;


  Some antiviruses and pieces of software deactivate the Update service we need, resulting in the error you see. Let's fix that!


  >\- Press `Windows` + `R`
  >\- Type  `services.msc`
  >\- Press `Enter`
  >
  >
  >\- Double Click `Windows Update Service`
  >\- Set its `Startup` to `Automatic`
  >\- Click on `Start`
  >\- Click on `Ok`

  Then let's try updates again!
</details>

---

### Minimum version

Some of the tools we need to install have been release with the `1903` version **or above** of Windows 10 so we need to make sure you have at least this one.


>\- Press `Windows` + `R`
>\- Type  `winver`
>\- Press `Enter`


Check the **Version number**:


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :x: If it is below `1903`, just follow the [Latest version of Windows](#Latest-version-of-Windows) paragraph above to install the latest updates.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: If it says at least `1903`, you are good to go! :sunglasses:



### Virtualization

We need to ensure that the Virtualization options are enabled in the BIOS of your computer.

For many computers, this is already the case. Let's check:


>\- Press `Windows` + `R`
>\- Type  `taskmgr`
>\- Press `Enter`
>
>
>\- Click on the `Performance` tab
>\- Click on `CPU`


![task_manager.jpg](images/task_manager.jpg)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: The status will be listed under the graph and will say "Virtualization: Enabled" if this tool is enabled.


---

#### :wrench: Potential Fixes

<details>
  <summary>Activate Virtualization</summary>

  &nbsp;


  We need to access the BIOS / UEFI of the computer to activate it.


  >\- Press `Windows + R`
  >\- Type  `shutdown.exe /r /o /t 1`
  >\- Press `Enter`
  >
  >
  >\- Wait for the computer to shutdown
  >
  >
  >\- Click on `Troubleshoot`
  >\- Click on `Advanced Options`
  >\- Click on `UEFI Firmware Settings`
  >\- Click on `Restart`


  You need to activate the virtualization option for your processor here:
  - Most of the time, in the advanced settings, the CPU settings, or the Northbridge settings
  - The option can be called differently according to your computer:
      - Intel: `Intel VT-x`, `Intel Virtualization Technology`, `Virtualization Extensions`, `Vanderpool`...
      - AMD: `SVM Mode` or `AMD-V`
  - Save the changes after activation and reboot the computer through the appropriate option
</details>

## Windows Subsystem for Linux
### Install WSL 1
WSL is the development environment we are using to run Ubuntu. You can learn more about WSL [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq).

We will install WSL through the PowerShell Terminal:


:warning: In the following instruction, please be aware of the `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter` key stroke to execute **Windows PowerShell** with administrator privileges instead of just clicking on `Ok`or pressing `Enter`.


>\- Press `Windows` + `R`
>\- Type  `powershell`
>\- Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter`


:warning: You may have to accept the UAC confirmation about the privilege elevation.


&nbsp;
A blue terminal window will appear:


>\- Copy the following commands
>\- Paste them into the PowerShell window by right-clicking into it (`Ctrl` + `V` does not work here!)
>\- Run them by pressing `Enter`


&nbsp;
```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: When all three commands ran without any error, you can restart your computer.


### Upgrade to WSL 2
Once your computer has restarted, we need to download the WSL2 installer.


>\- Go to the [download page](https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel) and get the installer
>\- Click `Next`
>\- Click `Finish`

![update_wsl](images/update_wsl.jpg)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :x: If you encounter the error `This update only applies to machines with the Windows Subsystem for Linux`, **right click** on the program and select `uninstall`; you shall be able to install it normally this time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: If everything is fine, we are ready to use WSL 2 instead of WSL 1!

### Make WSL 2 the default Windows Subsystem for Linux
Now that WSL 2 is installed, let's use it by default when we deal with WSL:


>\- Press `Windows` + `R`
>\- Type  `cmd`
>\- Press `Enter`


In the window which appears, type:

```bash
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: You can close this Command Prompt terminal; we are ready to install Ubuntu!


## Ubuntu
### Installation


>\- Click on `Start`
>\- Type  `Microsoft Store`
>\- Click on the Microsoft Windows Store in the list
>
>
>\- Search for `Ubuntu` in the search bar
>\- Select version without any number, just plain "Ubuntu"
>
>
>\- Click on `Install`


:warning: Don't install **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** nor **Ubuntu 20.04**!

---

#### :wrench: Potential Fixes


<details>
  <summary>Uninstall wrong versions of Ubuntu</summary>

  &nbsp;


  To uninstall a wrong version of Ubuntu, you just have to go to the Installed Program List of Windows 10:


  >\- Press `Windows` + `R`
  >\- Type  `ms-settings:appsfeatures`
  >\- Press `Enter`


  Find the right software to uninstall and click on the uninstall button.
</details>

---


&nbsp;
Once the installation is done, the `Install` button becomes a `Launch` button:


>\- Click on `Launch`


At first launch, you will be asked some information:
- Choose a **username**:
    - one word
    - lowercase
    - no special characters
    - for example: `lewagon` or your `firstname`
- Choose a **password**
- Confirm your password


:warning: When typing the password, nothing will not appear on the screen — there will be no familiar typing indicator even though your keystrokes are being registered!

:warning: This is a security feature to mask not only your password as a whole but also its length!


&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: The installation should be complete; you can close the Ubuntu window now that it is installed on your computer.

### Check the WSL version of Ubuntu


>\- Press `Windows` + `R`
>\- Type  `cmd`
>\- Press `Enter`


Type the following command:

```bash
wsl -l -v
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :x: If the version of Ubuntu WSL is 1, we will need to convert it to version 2.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: If the version of Ubuntu WSL is 2, you are ready to install VS Code!


---

#### :wrench: Potential Fixes


<details>
  <summary>Convert Ubuntu WSL V1 to V2</summary>


  &nbsp;


  In the Command Prompt window, type:

  ```bash
  wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
  ```

  &nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: After a few seconds, you should get the following message: `The conversion is complete`.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :x: If it does not work, we need to be sure that Ubuntu files are not compressed.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Check for Uncompressed Files</summary>


  &nbsp;
  >\- Press `Windows` + `R`
  >\- Type  `%localappdata%\Packages`
  >\- Press `Enter`
  >
  >
  >\- Open the folder named `CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows...`
  >\- Right Click on the `LocalState` folder
  >\- Click on `Properties`
  >\- Click on `Advanced`
  >\- Make sure that the option `Compress content` is **not** ticked, then click on `Ok`.


  Apply changes to this folder only and try to convert the Ubuntu WSL version again.

</details>

---


(You can now close this Command Prompt window.)



## Visual Studio Code

We use Visual Code Studio for writing code on Windows, because it integrates nicely with the Ubuntu terminal.

For this integration to work, you need to uninstall other code editor, like for example SublimeText, as their WSL integration interferes with the integration of VS Code.

### Installation
>\- Go to the [Visual Studio Code page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
>\- Choose the Windows version of VS Code


The tool should start to download automatically.

>\- Open the file you have just downloaded.
>\- Install it with a few options:
>    \- Register VS Code as an editor for supported file types
>    \- Let the other options as they are

![VS Code install](images/vscode-install.png)

### Connecting VS Code to Ubuntu

- Launch VS Code a first time, then:
    - Pin it to the taskbar; you will be using it a lot!
    - You should have a frame at the bottom-right corner of VS Code saying it detects WSL
    - Accept the installation of the WSL extension for VS Code

:warning: This extension is mandatory for you to be able to work with VS Code!

### VS Code Shortcuts

In VS Code:


>\- Click on `File`
>\- Click on `Preferences`
>\- Click on `Keymaps`
>\- Click on `Sublime Text Keymap and Settings Importer`
>\- Click on `Install`


### VS Code Extensions

Let's gain time now and add other extensions that will be helpful during your Bootcamp.


For each of these extensions:


>\- On the web page, click on `install`
>\- In the browser, accept to use VS Code to install the extension
>\- In VS Code, click on `install`

For everyone
- [Sublime Text Keymap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings)

For the Web Development bootcamp:
- [Rails Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hridoy.rails-snippets)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [ERB Helper Tags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rayhanw.erb-helpers)
- [ruby-rubocop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=misogi.ruby-rubocop)

For the Data Science bootcamp:
- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
- [Python Indent](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KevinRose.vsc-python-indent)

### VS Code Settings
>\- Press `Ctrl` + `,` on your keyboard to open the settings
>\- In the search bar, type `emmet`
>\- Click on the first **`Edit in settings.json`** link


Paste the following just before the last `}`:

```bash
"emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab": true,
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
  "erb": "html"
},
```

It should look like this:

![vscode_emmet](images/vscode_emmet.jpg)

:warning: You should add a comma if there is none after the **`]`** like line 26 in the image above ☝️


:warning: Don't forget to save those changes!

### Final Check

To make sure everything works fine, close VS Code, then open your Ubuntu terminal:


>\- Press `Windows` + `R`
>\- Type  `ubuntu`
>\- Press `Enter`


In Ubuntu, let's try to launch VS Code:

```bash
code
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: If Visual Studio Code opens, your code editor is ready! :muscle:


## Windows Terminal

The standard Ubuntu terminal is a very crude way of using Ubuntu; let's use a real modern terminal!

### Installation

We first need to install **Windows Terminal** from the Microsoft Windows Store:


>\- Click on `Start`
>\- Type  `Microsoft Store`
>\- Click on the Microsoft Windows Store in the list
>
>
>\- Search for `Windows Terminal` in the search bar
>
>
>\- Click on `Install`


Once the installation is done, the `Install` button becomes a `Launch` button:


>\- Click on `Launch`
>\- Right Click on the icon in the taskbar
>\- Choose to pin the app to the bar


This terminal allows you to open multiple terminal sessions, including **PowerShell**, **Command Prompt** and **Ubuntu** that you installed earlier.

This terminal has tabs: you can choose to open a new terminal tab clicking on the **down arrow** / **v-shape** next to the current one.

:warning: From now on, we will only need **Ubuntu** as a terminal.

### Ubuntu as the default terminal

Let's make Ubuntu the default terminal of your Windows Terminal application.


>\- Press `Ctrl` + `,`


It should open the settings:

![wsl2_settings](images/settings_wsl2.PNG)

We have put in red the part we will use or change.


&nbsp;


First, let us ask Ubuntu to start directly inside your Ubuntu Home Directory instead of the Windows one:



>\- Locate the `"name": "Ubuntu",`
>\- Add the following line after it:

```bash
"startingDirectory": "//wsl$/Ubuntu/home/the-username-you-chose-at-the-ubuntu-install",
```

:warning: Do not forget the comma at the end of the line!

:warning: Do not forget to replace the username by your own in the line above!



&nbsp;

Now, let us ask Windows Terminal to start directly an Ubuntu Terminal when launched:




>\- Locate the `"guid"` for Ubuntu  
>\- Copy the value between `{` and `}`  
>\- Locate the `"defaultProfile"`   
>\- Replace the value between `{` and `}` with what you copied from above   
>\- Add a comma after the `defaultProfile` so you can add the `"multiLinePasteWarning": false,` option as well. This will disable an annoying warning every time you want to paste multiple lines to your terminal.  

You can refer to the screenshot above to get a sense of how it should look like. Don't hesitate to ask for help.


:warning: Do not forget to save those changes!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: Voilà, your **Windows Terminal** is setup! :confetti_ball:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **From now on, every time we will refer to the terminal or the console it will be this one.**



## Git

To install `git`:


>\- Open an Ubuntu terminal.
>\- Copy and paste the following lines:


```bash
sudo apt update
```
```bash
sudo apt install -y git apt-transport-https unzip gnome-terminal
````

Let's now install GitHub [official CLI](https://cli.github.com) (Command Line Interface) with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-key C99B11DEB97541F0
sudo apt-add-repository https://cli.github.com/packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gh
```

To check that `gh` has been successfully installed on your machine, you can run:

```bash
gh --version
```

If you don't get a prompt saying `gh version X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)` with at least version 1.4, please refer to [the documentation](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#official-sources) where they list some troubleshooting information. In doubt, ask a TA.


## Oh-my-zsh - Fancy your Terminal

We will use the shell named `zsh` instead of `bash`, the default one.

```bash
# it will ask for your session password
sudo apt install -y zsh curl vim imagemagick jq
```
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

At then end, your terminal should look like this:

![zsh](images/wsl2_zsh.jpg)


&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: If everything is correct, let's configure GitHub!

---

#### :wrench: Potential Fixes

<details>
  <summary>Error: "chsh command unsuccessful. Change your default shell manually."</summary>

  &nbsp;


  You probably typed the wrong password when asked.
  Starting the script again will not work as it will try to create a configuration folder that now already exists!

  We need to remove it first:

  ```bash
  rm -rf ~/.oh-my-zsh
  ```


  Then let's try again!
</details>

---


## GitHub

We need to generate SSH keys which are going to be used by GitHub and Heroku
to authenticate you. Think of it as a way to log in, but different from the
well known username/password couple. If you already generated keys
that you already use with other services, you can skip this step.

Open a terminal and type this, replacing the email with **yours** (the
same one you used to create your GitHub account). It will prompt
for information. Just press enter until it asks for a **passphrase**.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh && ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -o -a 100 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -C "TYPE_YOUR_EMAIL@HERE.com"
```

**NB:** when asked for a passphrase, put something you want (and that you'll remember),
it's a password to protect your private key stored on your hard drive. You'll type,
nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. Just type the passphrase,
and when you're done, press `Enter`.

Then you need to give your **public** key to GitHub. Run:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

It will prompt on the screen the content of the `id_ed25519.pub` file.


>\- Copy that text from `ssh` to the end of your email address
>\- Go to [github.com/settings/ssh](https://github.com/settings/ssh)
>\- Click on the green button `New SSH key`
>\- Fill in the Title with your computer name (`Macbook Pro` for instance)
>\- Paste the **Key**
>\- Finish by clicking on the **Add key** green button.


To check that this step is completed, in the terminal run this.

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

:warning: You will be prompted a warning, type `yes` then `Enter`.

This is the expected result:

```
# Hi --------! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access
```

## Linking your default browser to Ubuntu
To be sure that you can interact with your browser installed on Windows from your new Ubuntu terminal, we need to set it as your default browser there.

⚠️ You need to execute at least one of the following commands below:


<details>
  <summary>Google Chrome as your default browser</summary>

  &nbsp;


  Run the command:

  ```bash
    ls /mnt/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe
  ```

  If you get an error like `ls: cannot access...` Run the following command:

  ```bash
    echo "export BROWSER='\"/mnt/c/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe\"'" >> ~/.zshrc
  ```

  Else run:

  ```bash
    echo "export BROWSER='\"/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe\"'" >> ~/.zshrc
  ```

</details>


<details>
  <summary>Mozilla Firefox as your default browser</summary>

  &nbsp;


  Run the command:

  ```bash
    ls /mnt/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Mozilla\ Firefox/firefox.exe
  ```

  If you get an error like `ls: cannot access...` Run the following command:

  ```bash
    echo "export BROWSER='\"/mnt/c/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe\"'" >> ~/.zshrc
  ```

  Else run:

  ```bash
    echo "export BROWSER='\"/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe\"'" >> ~/.zshrc
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Microsoft Edge as your default browser</summary>

  &nbsp;


  Run the command:


  ```bash
  echo "export BROWSER='\"/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft/Edge/Application/msedge.exe\"'" >> ~/.zshrc
  ```
</details>


Please make sure that the following command returns "Browser defined 👌":

```bash
[ -z "$BROWSER" ] && echo "ERROR: please define a BROWSER environment variable ⚠️" || echo "Browser defined 👌"
```

If it does not, choose a browser in the list above and execute the corresponding command.

Restart your terminal.


## GitHub CLI

CLI is the acronym of [Command-line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

In this section, we will install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to perform useful actions with GitHub data directly from the Terminal.

It should already be installed on your laptop from the previous commands. First you need to **login**:

```bash
gh auth login -s 'user:email' -w
```

You will get the following output:

```bash
- Logging into github.com

! First copy your one-time code: 0EF9-D015
- Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...
```

Select and copy the code (`0EF9-D015` in the example), then type `Enter`. Your browser will open and ask you to authorize GitHub CLI to use your GitHub account. Accept and wait a bit. Come back to the terminal, type `Enter` again, and that should be it :tada:

To check that you are properly connected, type:

```bash
gh auth status
```

If you get `Logged in to github.com as <YOUR USERNAME> `, then all good.

Then run the following configuration line:

```bash
gh config set git_protocol ssh
```

Finally, create a [gist](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists) to make sure `gh` is working:

```bash
echo "Hello [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com) :wave:" | gh gist create -d "Starting my coding journey..." -f "SETUP_DAY.md" -p -w
```

This line should open your browser on the newly created gist page. See, we've just created a [**Markdown**](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) file!


Hackers love to refine and polish their shell and tools.

We'll start with a great default configuration provided by Le Wagon: [`lewagon/dotfiles`](http://github.com/lewagon/dotfiles).

As your configuration is personal, you need your **own** repository storing it. Forking means
that it will create a new repo in your GitHub account, identical to the original one.
You'll have a new repository on your GitHub account, `$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles`.
We need to fork because each of you will need to put **specific** information (e.g. your name) in those files.

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
export GITHUB_USERNAME=`gh api user | jq -r '.login'`
echo $GITHUB_USERNAME
```

You should see your GitHub username printed. If it's not the case, **stop here** and ask for help.
There seems to be a problem with the previous step (`gh auth`).

Time to fork the repo and clone it on your laptop:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME && cd $_
gh repo fork lewagon/dotfiles --clone
```

Run the `dotfiles` installer.

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles && zsh install.sh
```

Check the emails registered with your GitHub Account. You'll need to pick one
at the next step:

```bash
gh api user/emails | jq -r '.[].email'
```

Run the git installer:

```bash
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles && zsh git_setup.sh
```

:point_up: This will **prompt** you for your name (`FirstName LastName`) and your email. Be careful
you **need** to put one of the email listed above thanks to the previous `gh api ...` command. If you
don't do that, Kitt won't be able to track your progress.

Please now **quit** all your opened terminal windows.


&nbsp;


Let us open the `~/.zshrc` profile file in Visual Code Studio and change slightly its content:

```bash
code ~/.zshrc
```

>\- Locate the line `# Actually load Oh-My-Zsh`
>\- **Above it** write the following line:

```bash
ZSH_DISABLE_COMPFIX=true
```

&nbsp;


You don't want to be asked for your passphrase every time you communicate with a distant repository. So, you need to add the plugin `ssh-agent` to `oh my zsh`:


>\- Spot the line starting with `plugins=`
>\- Add `ssh-agent` to the plugins list.

The list should look like:

```
plugins=(gitfast last-working-dir common-aliases sublime zsh-syntax-highlighting history-substring-search ssh-agent)
```

&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :white_check_mark: Save the `.zshrc` file with `Ctrl` + `S` and close Visual Code Studio.



## Installing Ruby (with [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv))

First, we need to clean up any previous Ruby installation you might have:

```bash
rvm implode && sudo rm -rf ~/.rvm
# If you got "zsh: command not found: rvm", carry on. It means `rvm` is not
# on your computer, that's what we want!

rm -rf ~/.rbenv
```

Then in the terminal, run:

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential tklib zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libreadline-dev
```
```bash
sudo apt clean
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
```

**Close your terminal and open it again** (Alt+F4 and restart it). If you get a warning, just **ignore** it from now (Ruby is not installed yet).


Now, you are ready to install the latest ruby version and set it as the default version.

Run this command, it will **take a while (5-10 minutes)**

```bash
rbenv install 2.6.6
```

Once the ruby installation is done, run this command to tell the system
to use the 2.6.6 version by default.

```bash
rbenv global 2.6.6
```

Then **restart** your Terminal again (close it and reopen it).

```bash
ruby -v
```

You should see something starting with `ruby 2.6.6p`.

## Installing some gems

---

<details>
  <summary>Click here if you are in :cn: <bold>China</bold></summary>


  &nbsp;

  :warning: If you are in China, you should update the way we'll install gem with the following commands.

```bash
# China only!
gem sources --remove https://rubygems.org/
gem sources -a https://gems.ruby-china.com/
gem sources -l
# *** CURRENT SOURCES ***
# https://gems.ruby-china.com/
# Ruby-china.com must be in the list now
```
</details>

---

All, please run the following line:

```bash
gem install rake bundler rspec rubocop rubocop-performance pry pry-byebug colored http
```

If you encounter the following error:

`
ERROR: While executing gem ... (TypeError)
incompatible marshal file format (can't be read)
format version 4.8 required; 60.33 given
`

Run the following command:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.gemrc
```

Rerun the command to install the gems.

**Never** install a gem with `sudo gem install`! Even if you stumble upon a Stackoverflow answer
(or the Terminal) telling you to do so.


## Installing Node (with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.0/install.sh | zsh
```

Restart your terminal and run the following:

```bash
nvm -v
```
You should see a version.

Now let's install node:

```bash
nvm install 14.15.0
```

When the command returns, run

```bash
node -v
```

You should see `v14.15.0`.


## PostgreSQL

In a few weeks, we'll talk about SQL and Databases and you'll need something called PostgreSQL, an open-source robust and production-ready database.

Let's install it now.


```bash
sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev build-essential
```
```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start
```
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql --command "CREATE ROLE `whoami` LOGIN createdb;"
```

You can configure PostgreSQL to autostart, so you don't have to execute `sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start` each time you open a new terminal:

```bash
sudo echo "`whoami` ALL=NOPASSWD:/etc/init.d/postgresql start" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/postgresql
```
```bash
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/postgresql
```
```bash
echo "sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start" >> ~/.zshrc
```


## Check-up

Let's check if you successfully installed everything.

Quit all opened Terminal, open a new one and run the following commands:

```bash
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/setup/master/check.rb > _.rb && ruby _.rb || rm _.rb
```

It should tell you if your workstation is ready :)



## Ubuntu File System

### Exchange files between Windows and Ubuntu

We need an easy way to transfer files from Windows to Ubuntu and vice versa.

In order to do that, we will create shortcuts to Ubuntu directories in the Windows **File Explorer**.

![](images/wsl_ubuntu_file_system.png)

Here are the steps:

- Open an Ubuntu terminal
- Open the Windows File Explorer (or use the shortcut Win + E)
- In the Address Bar, enter `\\wsl$\` (or `\\wsl$\Ubuntu` if it does not work)
- You now have acces to the Ubuntu file system
- Dive into the Ubuntu file system in order to look for directories of interest
- Drag the desired folders into the Address Bar in order to create shortcuts

![](images/wsl_ubuntu_file_system.gif)

### Open the Windows File Explorer from the Ubuntu terminal

Another option to move files around is to open the Windows **File Explorer** from the Ubuntu terminal.

In order to do that:

- Open an Ubuntu terminal
- Go to the directory you wish to explore
- Run the `explorer.exe .` command (alternatively, use `wslview .`)
- If you get an input output error message, run `wsl --shutdown` in a Windows PowerShell and reopen an Ubuntu terminal

![](images/wsl_explorer.png)

### Find your way in the Ubuntu File System

You might want to figure out the exact location of a Windows directory in the Ubuntu file system, or the other way around.

In order to convert a Windows path to and from an Ubuntu path:

- Open an Ubuntu terminal
- Use the `wslpath "C:\Program Files"` command in order to translate a Windows path into an Ubuntu path
- Use the `wslpath -w "/home"` command in order to translate an Ubuntu path into a Windows path
- In particular, the `wslpath -w $(pwd)` command returns the Windows path of the current Ubuntu directory
